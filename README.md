# WACCM4-Nuclear-Winter-Analysis
This repo was set up to analyze the nuclear winter climate model of [Coupe et al. 2019](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019JD030509). The initial motivation is to look at the impact of a nuclear winter on renewable energy production.

`scripts/Explore.ipynb` is currently the main notebook of this project, which queries the Coupe et al. data to make some useful figures. Start there; it contains useful explanations.

Note that the Coupe et al. data must be manually downloaded and unzipped in the `data` directory. It can be downloaded [here](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/WACCM4_150_Tg_US-Russia/7742735/2).
